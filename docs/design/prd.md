6. Open Questions
6.1 Technical Decisions
Real-time Features: Should we implement real-time notifications using Supabase subscriptions or polling? What’s the expected frequency of updates?

File Processing: Do we need server-side file processing (PDF generation, image resizing) or client-side handling? What are the performance implications?

Offline Capability: Should students be able to work on assignments offline and sync when connected? How critical is this feature?

Mobile App: Is a native mobile app (React Native) required in the initial release, or can we rely on the responsive web app?

6.2 Business Logic
Grading System: Should we support weighted grades, extra credit, or curved grading? What grading scales are required (A-F, 0-100, Pass/Fail)?

Course Capacity: How should we handle course enrollment limits? Should there be a waitlist system?

Assignment Types: Beyond text and file submissions, do we need support for quizzes, peer reviews, or group assignments?

Academic Calendar: Should the system integrate with academic calendars for semester/quarter management?

6.3 Compliance and Security
Data Retention: What are the requirements for storing student data after course completion? How long should submissions be retained?

Accessibility: What WCAG compliance level is required? Do we need screen reader optimization and keyboard navigation?

Integration Requirements: Will the system need to integrate with existing Student Information Systems (SIS) or Single Sign-On (SSO) providers?

Backup and Recovery: What are the RTO/RPO requirements for data backup and disaster recovery?

6.4 Scalability Considerations
User Limits: What’s the expected number of concurrent users? How many courses and assignments per teacher?

Storage Growth: What’s the projected storage growth rate? When should we implement storage quotas or cleanup policies?

Performance Benchmarks: What are the acceptable page load times and response times for different operations?

Geographic Distribution: Will the system serve users globally? Do we need multi-region deployment?
